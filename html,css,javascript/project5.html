	<h1>CSS positioning </h1>
	<p><em>Fixed Positioning </em> &rsquo;fixes&lsquo; the position of an element relative to the browser window. The element always stays fixed in place, even when scrolling.</p>
	<p><em> Absolute Positioning </em> takes an element out of document flow, meaning the browser acts as if the element has no width and height, and the other elements on the page move up as if it was never there. The position of the element is then fixed relative to the top level container, or the closest parent with a set positioning.</p>
	<p><em>Relative positioning</em> sets the position of an element relative to its original position. The element's original width and height is retained in document flow and other elements behave as if it was in its original postion. (initial position is under green box. relative position does not change its original position.) </p>

	<p><em>Static positioning</em> is the default behaviour of elements. <em> Inherited positioning</em> tells an element to inerit its positioning from its parent element. <em>Z-Index</em> controls the verticlal stacking order of elements. Elements must have a set positioning for z-index to work.</p>
