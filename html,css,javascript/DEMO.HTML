		<p><h1>Front End Development Code Review Process</h1>
		Created by Kalyan Sripathi on Jun 15, 2018 Go to start of metadata</p>
	
	
		<p><em>Purpose</em>
		I want to let the team know that, this is in no way supposed to be personal or a critique of your technical competence. We all have our areas of strengths and areas we can improve on. This is a chance to give the team and also the reviewer a chance to improve their technical skills and also get a fresh perspective on things.</p><br>
		<p><em>How is the reviewer selected?</em>
		The reviewer is selected based on their general experience with front-end development, functional and domain knowledge. If someone has specific experience with the project or the specific technical requirements they will be given preference.We will be selecting reviewers for different projects from India and NA , so if you think a certain project/programming language is your area of expertise please reach out to us.</p>
