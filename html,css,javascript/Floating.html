		<p><em>Floating</em> positions an element according to document flow,a nd then moves it to the far right as possible. Elements following a floated elemts will move up as far as possible.</p>
		<p><em> Floating left </em>removes an element from normal document flow. It then takes that element and pushes it to the left as possible. Other elements will move up as far as possible to flow around the element and takes its original space.</p>
		<p><em>Floating right</em> removes an element from normal document flow. It then pushes the element to the far right as possible. Other elements will move up as far as possible to flow around the element and take the original space.</p>
		<P> One of the most commomnly asked questions is how to <em>center elements</em> since there is no option to float center. But by thinking carefully about how elemnts behave, we can use positioning to achieve the same result.</P>
